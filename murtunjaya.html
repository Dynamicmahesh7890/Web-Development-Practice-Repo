        “Good morning! How was your weekend? Mine was relaxing—I caught up on some reading and tried a new recipe. By the way, have you seen the latest movie everyone’s talking about? It’s a gripping thriller. Oh, and did you hear about the upcoming concert? I’m thinking of getting tickets. Anyway, back to work—I have a meeting in an hour. Let’s catch up later!”
