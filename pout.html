        <p id="madhu">"Hi! I’m i ma mahesh . Chess is my jam—there's nothing like the thrill of strategizing and outwitting an opponent on the board. When I'm not deep into a match, I enjoy the tranquility of my own company and can code for hours on end, losing myself in the world of logic and creativity. Life's simple pleasures</p>
